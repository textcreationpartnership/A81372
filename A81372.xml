            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But this being the proper work of the enſuing Diſcourſe, I ſhall not detain you here.</p>
            <p>Onely a word or two by way of Apologie for this my undertaking, conſidering the ordinary or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary influence which the right or wrong ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement hereof may have upon the ſpirits of men to effect good or evil to my ſelf or them thereby, wherein I o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Some I confeſs plead them to ſet up their luſts by a Law, but againſt theſe (as the bleſſed truths themſelves) are the very points of my endeavours moſt avowedly preſt, as the ſequel manifeſts.

            <p>And now to gather in all to our preſent purpoſe; having taken this pains to ſhew you our calamities in general, both from Gods Word, and right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the ſure Rules, both as we are Chriſtians and Men, with ſhort applications onely here and there interweaved, that by the continuance of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſo univerſal, we might not forget to whom it is ſpoken; I come now more particularly to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the preſent <hi>Plea,</hi> as it is more eſpecially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, that I may exactly diſcover theſe exorbitances in their cauſes as well as in their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, I ſhall (and I hope without much offence) rank the offenders into two ſorts of men (to whom all others may be reduced, as partaking more or leſs of their ways and principles.) The one ſort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying onely upon themſelves, are full of ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, enamoured with a high confidence of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility: The other look more to a conſent of combination, in the declaration of their joynt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. The firſt think themſelves ſtrong, becauſe they pretend wholly to the direction of the Spirit in their way; the ſecond, although they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict not the truth of the Spirits direction promiſed to the children of God, yet they put their ſtrength rather in a humane then ſpiritual way of acting. But the truth indeed is, that neither the one nor the other, in matters of debate, hold forth to any, or follow themſelves, any approved Rules by which they govern themſelves to edification about theſe controverſies, either to the ſpiritual or rational part in queſtion therein. And although this may
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:121332:19"/> be ſaid of both, yet it cannot be denied, but that the ſecond ſort of them, for the moſt part, are more capable of entertaining Rules, when offered, then the firſt, becauſe many of the former (incircling all within the narrow Idea of their own imagined perfections, tranſported with a like conceit of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the <hi>aenigma's</hi> of Scripture, yea, and with the very <hi>punctum's</hi> of circumſtance, time, perſons, and matter of every Prophecy therein, and therefrom giving the free reins to a ſtrange kind of liberty which they call ſpiritual,) take up the principles of ſuch diſorders, both as to themſelves and others, equally as inſenſibly as irrationally; inſomuch as it becomes a thing almoſt impoſſible to fix them to any thing, eſpecially if it never ſo little run croſs to their eſpouſed reſolutions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the latter are rather too enclined to fix upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Rules, and humane reaſonings; but yet in both this is evident, that whenſoever either of them ſet themſelves to promote any belief of their own, or maintain any ſuppoſed truth, it is uſhered forth for the moſt part, not ſo much with the warrant and countenance of Gods unerring Word, (the right underſtanding of which, if any place by them be alledged, they will not eaſily be drawn to) as with unmeet paſſions, tergiverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or elſe evaſive incongruities, rather to uphold (and that profeſſedly) the outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a party, to vindicate it from aſperſion, or to gain ſome advantage to its proceedings by the diſgrace of others, then to make (truly I may with charity enough ſuſpect) a diſcovery of naked truth in relation to the honour of Chriſt, or his Kingdome, that the neceſſity of the former, and the evidence of the latter may become indifferently recommendable to the conſciences of his people; or that the conſcience of thoſe who have not ſo duly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:121332:20"/> tendered the ſame as they ought, may be brought back again unto their duty, and right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof. Whence we daily ſee, that the reſult of ſuch paſſionate undertakings, fomented (as I ſaid) by the private cenſures and whiſpers of ſome, and enflamed by the raſh pens of others, hath brought forth no other fruit then the diſ-repute of Truth, and ſcandal of Religion.</p>
            <p>To come yet more nearly and plainly: I am not ignorant how much, and in what way ſome complain of thoſe evils which we now conceive our burthen, how they cry out againſt the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences thereof, and what an <hi>Odium</hi> they endeavour to caſt upon ſome, by whoſe fault (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) we are fallen into them; O! ſay they, this is by reaſon of evil Magiſtrates, and the ill management of Government; and ſo they are cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and aſperſed according to the apprehenſions of each party: O! ſaith one party, if I had had the modelizing of the Government, I would have put it in ſuch a method as ſhould have been againſt all exceptions; if I had had the choice of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, I would have ſet up ſuch as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he comes, would have approved of, that ſhould have been a nurſing Father indeed to the Saints,<note place="margin">Thus like heedleſs Flyes ſome play with the light until they are dazled therewith to their ruine.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:121332:20"/> without adhering to any party, but impartially endeavouring to preſerve all in a juſt freedome and protection; for if the Government had been of ſuch a Size, then it had been too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and too ſhort for the dimenſions of ſuch an Opinion; and if proportionable to ſuch, then too broad and too long for a third, and ſo it would never have fitted the mould of all Judgements, the meaneſt of which would not have wanted both Scripture and Reaſon too, in their conceits, that their advice might take the precedency. And ſo for the Magiſtrate himſelf, who hath therefore found it his wiſdome, and we our ſafety; that he rather (as he was wont to ſay) play the Conſtable to preſerve the peace, from the violence and rage of each perſwaſion, which would willingly, beſides it, have no other in the world.

            <p>There is a great reſemblance between an evil Tongue, and Fire. 1. For the heat of it, 'tis the inſtrument of wrath and contention, which is the heat of a man, a boyling of the bloud about the heart. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">

            <p>I argue hence, 1. If it be our Duty to pray to live peaceably under our Governours, then ſurely it is our Duty to practiſe it. 2. If we ought to pray thus for evil Governours, then much more for the good, that they may be preſerved ſtill to be nurſing Fathers to us: If for Heathens, then more eſpecially for Chriſtians, and for profeſſing Chriſtians, whom the Lord by ſo many ſignal teſtimonies hath owned, and wrought by ſuch wonderfull deliverances, of which hereafter. 3. If I ought thus to pray for them, then ſurely I muſt do them all the good I can; for I take this to be a clear principle in Chriſtianity, as an undeniable Argument againſt all opponents, That whoſoever I am bound in duty to pray for, I ought in my utmoſt endeavours, by all good ways and means, to procure good unto: But I ought to pray for all in Authority, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is to ſay, I ſhould make my paths ſtraight towards them, giving them no cauſe of offence in any thing, behaving my ſelf humbly and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards them, leſt my profeſſion of the Goſpel be blamed.</p>
            <p>I muſt apply my ſelf in love towards them, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my duty in my place and ſtation, to my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, for their peace and tranquillity. You have a notable place for this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.7. where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſending to the Jews then in captivity under Babyloniſh Tyranny, exhorts them, <hi>To ſeek the peace of the City, and pray unto the Lord for it; for in the peace thereof they ſhould have peace.</hi> O! this is to be Chriſtians indeed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. this
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:121332:30"/> would make Religion ſhine indeed before the world, far above all the fair ſhews, good words, and glorious pretences that can be made; for Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, like <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Magicians,<note place="margin">

            <p>In a due conſideration of which, I, as to my own Duty and Practiſe, thus poſitively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude;</p>

            <p n="2">2. That in the way of my lawfull Calling, if I muſt needs contend for truth and righteouſneſs, yet even then to remember that I ought to be ſlow to ſpeak, and ſlow to wrath, becauſe the wrath of Man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God.<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
               <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.19.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>Now then, for me, upon what pretence ſoever, to make it my work to reſiſt the Powers ordained of God over me, by calumniations, detractions, hard ſpeeches (as <hi>Davids</hi> enemies did, and indeed Gods enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140.1, 2, 3, 5. which I pray read) nay, to pray againſt them, that God would ruine them, inſtead of praying for them, and doing my duty as before laid down, is not onely to pull a curſe and ruine upon my ſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of hurting them, but withall to brand my ſelf to poſterity with infamy and impiety, as what greater can be?</p>

For Example. If I ſhould pray for the Magiſtrate, according to the Exhortation in <hi>Tim.</hi> afore-cited, I ſhould thereby harden him in evil, is a ſtrange concluſion; <hi>Paul</hi> was not of that minde at that time of that Exhortation, which was, as I have often ſaid, when <hi>Nero</hi> that Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reigned.

Nevertheleſs, having this clear call, I ſhall adventure, cenſure who will, to ſay ſome of that truth, by way of juſt Vindication of the <hi>Power</hi> thus unchriſtianly aſperſed, which is ſo plentifully known to me.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I muſt needs tell you, that it is a very great evil to raiſe falſe reports, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.1, 2, 3. and raſhly (as I have ſhewed) to credit them, as much a weakneſs; and truly I find it very natural, to have an ear ready for ſuch as whiſper out what makes to the prejudice or defamation of ſuch as we diſlike, and altogether deafned to whatſoever runs not with the current of our partial humours, by which means we become ſo ſadly deluded at this day,<note place="margin">The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> as this ſtrange piece of confidence manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; wherein we have not the Juſtice of Heathens, of one of whom it is recorded, that ſitting in Judgement, he would ever ſtop one of his ears, to hear the contrary party withal; for he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns a man till he hear him, doth unjuſtly, though there may be juſt cauſe to condemn him: One tale is good while another is told.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some men indeed bring him things in the name of the Spirit, that he judges weak and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh phantaſies,<note place="margin">Molliter, in epte.</note> rather the vapours of a diſtempered brain, as ſome diſtracted perſons that I have ſeen come to him, and ſome deluded poor ſouls, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing his more important affairs, and deviating his thoughts, almoſt tired out about the good and for the weal of the Nations: theſe ſometimes it may be he may ſlight, ſometimes chide for their impertinencies, yet moſt times, if he had any lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, moſt patiently hear while they had a humour
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:121332:40"/> to vent; but they going away diſpleaſed, that their Caſtles which they had built him,<note place="margin">De lana Caprina.</note> or others, in the Air, were no more regarded, they ſay he ſlights the Spirit, but doth any reaſonable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon think ſo?</p>
            <p n="3">3. I dare confidently ſay, No man ever yet heard him ſpeak againſt the perſwaſion of any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how far different ſoever from his own Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but on the contrary, he hath ever had the repute, even by his worſt Enemies, for a general lover and countenancer of all honeſt men, of whom I know not that man this day alive, that I can ſo truly ſay it as of him. It may be he may blame the perſon of ſome Profeſſour for walking ſcandalouſly, or contrary to his Profeſſion, as he hath had many times too much cauſe to do, but to charge the Judgement therewith, he hath been eminently moſt tender. And I can truly ſay further in his behalf herein, as it was the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> that <hi>he was more ready to conceal the vices of his friends then their vertues;</hi> ſo I have often known him to conceal, and that with no ordinary care, the ſeveral ſcandals, and other imprudencies of Profeſſours acting fooliſhly againſt him and the peace of the State, when he hath been tempted thereby to whip them with their own rod, and to ſuffer their own reproach to light on their own heads.</p>
            <p>And as to the impriſonment, perſecution, or oppreſſion of the people of God; I think thoſe that ſay it, do ſcarce believe it themſelves: He hath been a Sanctuary to all that walk orderly of any Opinion, as the ingenious of all parties do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. But of this, after.</p>
            <p>Indeed ſome that I have cauſe to believe well of, have been yet ſo peeviſhly imprudent, as to make their own <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and in a raſh diſſatisfaction
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:121332:40"/> (even with thoſe friends that have been their chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt encouragers) have turned the Key upon their own Liberties, becauſe they could not byaſs his publick care and affection, which ever ſtood equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poized to all. There are others like froward Children too much indulged of their Parents, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pleaſed with any thing, becauſe they are ſo much pleaſed and born with in every thing; and while by the ratling of their Chains they find Muſick to ſome people, they complain ſeemingly againſt them, while (alas) they like well to have them. Many will be popular by reſtraint, rather then die unregarded. But I delight not to help forward the afflictions of any, nor to unvail the nakedneſs of ſuch whom I truſt Chriſt hath caſt his Mantle of Love over, but rather bear their burthens, according to the Apoſtles Exhortation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. and practiſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. and therefore ſhall pray for them, that God would mercifully give them more meek and humble ſpirits, prudent hearts, a ſober and impartial underſtanding of their duty, and of things which they now concern themſelves in, and releaſe them, when they may come forth moſt to the honour of his Name, and their own thus laudable improvement!

May I beg your patience a little to look back upon his former deportments, and conſider how the Lord hath framed him for this great work. Was not always his heart knit to the intereſt of Gods people? How induſtrious was he, in the beginning of our troubles, to get an honeſt Regiment, even then when the power of Godlineſs was almoſt a Crime in the Army, (ſuch an earthly and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous rabble by the wiſdome and providence of God, who rules all things to his own purpoſes,<note place="margin">

And afterwards in his place and ſtation, was he not a principal Inſtrument in the modellizing of an honeſt Army under the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> at leaſt in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:121332:44"/> the placing in of honeſt Officers? how did he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite and encourage Gods people from the ſeveral Churches of the Nation to come in, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſtand by them upon all occaſions when they are in, againſt the proudeſt of their oppoſers? How did he make the profane tremble at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and caſhiere themſelves in apprehenſion of their own guilt and deſerts? I remember well his very name to me was a dread, while I under the captivation of Satan endeavoured to keep my idle courſes together with my Commiſſion. And how did he encourage meetings for Prayer, and mutual edifying in the moſt holy Faith? and all this to honeſt men, as honeſt men without exception: Let them that had the honour to ſerve the Lord and their Countrey in the year 1645. witneſs the truth with me. And is not he at this day a protection to us all? doth he not preſerve us from our ſelfiſh zeal againſt one another? hath he not the ſame tenderneſs to all Saints as ever? It is ſaid of <hi>Cato,</hi> that no man ſaw him changed, though he lived in a time when the Common weal was ſo often changed, he was the ſame in every condition, though he run through varieties of conditions: And he that ſaith otherwiſe of our Governour, (though they may have the confidence to object it) can never prove it; he of all men now living, that ſo eminently have had to do with all overtures as he hath had, is ſaid (by ſuch as have all along had the neareſt acquaintance with his judgement and practiſe) to ſucceed that excellent Queen, as in her other Vertues, ſo in deſert of that moſt Chriſtian Motto, <hi>(ſemper idem)</hi> to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame.</p>

And as it is our duty to wiſh and deſire this for him, ſo we are bound to give thanks to the Almighty Lord for his great mercy in ſo ordering his heart for the time paſt, and giving hopes for the future, that our Liberty (if we uſe it not as an occaſion to the fleſh) may be ſtill preſerved by him; and that we, and all that deſire to live a quiet and peaceable life in all God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Honeſty under him, may be encouraged, protected, and countenanced, and ſo by the ſpecial direction of God in his pious choice, under others, until he pleaſe to come, whoſe right it is to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and take the Diadem, as in order thereunto he hath promiſed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.27. who when he comes, will chain up Satan, burn up our droſs, and make us free indeed.

Once, give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and unto God the things that are Gods; due acknowledgements to both. The Jews have a ſaying, That the World ſtands upon three things; the Law, Holy Worſhip, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution; and if theſe things fall, the World will fall. If the murmuring ungratefull Jews ſhall exceed Chriſtians, nay if herein they ſhall turn Chriſtians, who ſhould be ever humble and thankfull, and the Chriſtians turn Jews, ſtiff-necked, and murmurers; we may ſay, either the World is falling, or turning up-ſide-down.

So much diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the God of our mercies, and weakning, what in us lies, his faithfull Inſtrument, that formerly did ſo freely venter life and limb, and what was

O! height of ingratitude! not to be parallell'd. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Muſculus</hi>) among all his Laws made none againſt men ungratefull; becauſe that was thought a thing ſo prodigious, as not to be committed by man.

What a ſcandal will this be to Religion, when the World ſhall be able to ſay of Profeſſours, that they are the moſt diſ-ingenious and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of men? Well, my friends, you may fling and vex thus peeviſhly at your comforts, and your mercies, and find many faults with the Governour now over you; but when it ſhall pleaſe God to take him away from you, as now in courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he is declining, I fear you will be none of the laſt that will have cauſe to bewail it; when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may ariſe, who will not with his wonted pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience know you, nor interpret you from evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. For my part, the more I conſider him, and duly weigh the ſtate of our Affairs, and temper of all in them, with what may come hereafter, me thinks truly I can never ſufficiently prize him, nor be thankfull enough to God for him, although I would not limit the Holy One, nor ſink in my due truſt and confidence in his never failing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to his people,<note place="margin">I have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved now (<hi>ſaith</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil) the age of a man, and ſee more union in Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then in Divinity; For in the Church I ſee ſuch diſſentions as do not onely divide them aſunder, but leave them open to the ruine of their enemies.</note> nor yet diſtruſt a faithfull choice by the Governour. Ah, poor ſouls! My hearts deſire and prayers to God for you is, that you may never ſin away your mercies into their hands that cannot call mercy, Mercy: That you may not ſet open your gates for the wilde Boars of the Forreſt to come in, and ſpoil your tender branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and lay waſte your Vineyard, that with ſo much care and toil, bloud and expence, hath been walled about for your defence and ſafety.</p>

            <p>That obedience to Magiſtrates is a ſtanding Duty until the coming of Chriſt, ſee 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13, 14. Let this be a caution to us all, That in our expectation, as to Chriſts reign, and ours with him, let us fear, leſt we be more carnal then truly ſpiritual, leſt we too much intereſt our ſelves under pretence of the Intereſt of Chriſt: For herein lies the great miſtake (as Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> well obſerves) to think that the Kingdomes of this World,<note place="margin">Goſpel Converſ.</note> and the Kingdome of Chriſt cannot ſtand together. If Chriſts Kingdome be not of this World,<note place="margin">See the <hi>Dutch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi> on <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.15.</note> as himſelf averreth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.36. it is not oppoſite to the Kingdomes of the World, and much leſs diſſolves them into it ſelf. So that the Kingdomes of this World may be ſet up, and the Kingdome of Chriſt too. <hi>Herod</hi> indeed upon this account perſecuted Chriſt, becauſe he heard a King of the Jews was born, but it was without cauſe; Jeſus Chriſt did not come to take the Kingdome of <hi>Herod</hi> away from him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the great wickedneſs of the Kings of the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. to conſpire againſt Chriſt, who did not envy them or their Kingdome; but they may live, and be the Kings of the Earth ſtill, and yet the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt may proſper; It doth not intrench upon any Civil Liberty of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:121332:48"/> men. Therefore I ſay again, It is a very great miſtake of ſuch as imagine, when the one riſes, the other needs muſt fall or that the one muſt ſwallow up the other, or at leaſt, that the Saints having the one muſt needs therefore poſſeſs the other: It doth not any way take away ſubjection to Civil Power on Earth, but rather make its Subjects more conformable thereto. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Opinion is of evil tendency (and I fear much the cauſe from whence your preſent buſtles take their riſe) and gives the Powers too much cauſe at this day (which was carefully prevented by Chriſt and his Diſciples,<note place="margin">

            <p>But Brethren, I would have you think, that the bleſſed and glorious Prophecies and Promiſes in Scripture made to Gods people, are as truly upon ſome other, though more ſilent hearts, as on yours, and as much heighten their expectations with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hopes of ſpiritual enlargements, as to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, love, peace, truth in the inward man, ſoul-ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying knowledge, a clearer, &amp; yet humble inſight into the excellent myſteries, treaſures, fountains of our Lord, now ſealed up in his ſacred Writ, or very darkly underſtood; and more ſtrength and grace to walk in conformity thereto: Theſe and many the like mercies are with faith and patience looked for in Gods own time to be graciouſly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in, and that by ſuch as you judge to be <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballats</hi> and <hi>Tobiahs</hi> rather, becauſe out of faith,<note place="margin">

            <p>My Reaſons are briefly theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Becauſe the people of God in places of power and truſt (the Lord ſtrengthening them, and giving them a heart to improve it rightly) may ſhine as lights in the midſt of a crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe generation (as a Beacon ſet upon a hill) that others ſeeing their good works may glorifie God: directing, and provoking others to the ſame laudable practiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They may hereby have a more eminent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, not onely to put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men, according to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. but alſo be as a bridle and awe upon their ſpirits, to deter and reſtrain them from that exceſs of riot, into which they would otherwiſe with more freedome run.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a good means to keep good men more cloſely and heedfully in the ways of God, ſo <hi>David
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:121332:52"/> Pſal.</hi> 39.1. and <hi>Nehemiah, cap.</hi> 5..9. leſt by them occaſion be given for the ways of God to be evil ſpoken of.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They thereby keep out worſe, that by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Magiſtrates would ſurely be preferred; and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly by miſ-information and confident inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may ſupply their rooms, even under the beſt, and moſt carefull Prince.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They are hereby more capacitated to cheriſh, countenance, and encourage the poor members of Jeſus Chriſt, that are diſtreſſed in the world, and oppreſſed by the wicked, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.4. <hi>&amp;c. Mat.</hi> 25.37, 40.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They may be inſtrumental in doing a great deal of good to ſuch as are under them, by their care of their ſouls as well as bodies. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They hereby make it appear to the world, that Chriſtians are no ſuch turbulent perſons as the black mouthes of their malicious adverſaries would make the world believe; but that they are men of quiet, meek, and peaceable ſpirits.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The people of God deſiſting, and (of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) leaving their publick places of Truſt, ſin againſt Gods mercifull diſpenſations, betray their truſt, ſlight, diſanul, fruſtrate (as much as in them lies) the bleſſed breathings and ſtruglings of the Spirit in the Saints of former Ages, and of the faithfull in this, whoſe prayers and tears have been to God without ceaſing for the accompliſhment of this very thing (among others) namely, that ſuch as truly fear God may manage the affairs of this Land in holineſs and peace.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And as to this preſent Authority I would one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ask you this Queſtion, What unlawful injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are now put upon good men in Truſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould wound their conſciences, or be in the leaſt diſcouraged from ſerving under the ſame?</p>
